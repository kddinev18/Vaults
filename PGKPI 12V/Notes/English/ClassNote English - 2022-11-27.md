Physical well being is very important especially for young children. Not only because of the benefits of the exercises but because of the habit they will develop which will be crucial in later point of their life.

Most of today's children just sit on their desks drawing or watching some sort of entertainment on their computers which is not the most healthy way to go about. Instead they can excercise once in a while for their own benefits and most importantly for their health. Most of the adults that have not excercised while they were kids have some king of health problem right now. Meaning the more excercies the better.

Furthermore apart from their health benefit they will educate themselves about the topic. Not only that but it will improove their learning skills because of the extra oxygen that is flowing into their brains. Not to mention that later in life this will proove to be crucial and the particular reason for that is that the brain never stops evolving even at that young age which in other words mean that they will become smarter and wiser.

To sum up, excercising is great both for the physical well beeing of the body and the brain. Although excercising or not if the child wants to become smarter, it will with serious studying. But it can not stay fit if he does not excercise. Maning the more important figure in terms of excercising is the healthy physic of the body.

Lucider is a TV show released in 2016 and it is about how the devil, Lucifer Mornigstar, took a vacation from hell in Los Angeles, California. Throught the series we see the devil in his true light: sleeples nights, parties etc. But what we and the devil didn't expexted is the appearence of detective Cloe Decker. The show is perfect for teenagers and even adults who want to experience exciting and romantic scenes full with crimes and even moments full of saddness. The show somehow got more than a 10 milion views on its pilot episode, suggesting the high appriciation and support the show has received from its community.

The show appeals to me not because of the devil concept but because of the empathetic relationships that are beeing created and sadly destroyed throught the series. The most exciting of which is the relationship between Lucifer and detective Cloe Decker. The show reveals that not only did the devil fall in love with the detective but that he has lost his mortality because of it.

Unfortunately the story of the series is finished meaning that there will be no more episodes from the franchise. But what could be done in the future is a separate TV show that explains the whole devine structure and how did the angel Samuil transformed in the devil Lucifer. Or maybe a prequel unfolding the story of some of the main caracter from the show. Although this is probably not going to happen I would love to watch it and eventually enjoy it with the whole community of this show.
