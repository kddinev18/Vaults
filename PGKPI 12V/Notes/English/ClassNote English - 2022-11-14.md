## 1. Informal letter/email
Hi Poli
Thanks for reaching out. Glad to hear from you and I'm really happy to hear that you finally got accepted into the school you wanted. And of cource I'm really excited that you will be styding here in Bulgaria. We will finally spend time together.

Anyway, I read that you wanted some advice about living in Bulgaria and the bulgarian schools in general and it will be pleasure for me to give you some. First tings first you have to be really careful especially in the school. You know that some of the students there will take advantage of tha fact that you don't know the native lenguage so be prepared. Even so, try to make some friends and try to be firendly in general.

Another thing is that you will have to be prepared for every class. And by that I don't mean to learn the next lesson before hand but to revise every class you have had so far. Because here in bulgaria we do a lot of tests. All in all, be prepared for some suprising tests or quizes in the morning.

And finally don't forget to have a good time here in Bulgaria. And I sincerely hope that you will like it. Don't forget that I will be here to help you no matter what is the problem so text me when you can.

Bye for now,
Kaloyan.

Recently I have expanded my knowledge in the area with a lot of diferent couses and tutorials. Apart from that I am a certified software programmer, software tester and poject manager. Knowig that your company is one of the best in this area and after careful considerations I decided that your comany was the best choice for an internship. Because not only I will be encoutering a lot more challenges but I will gain the relevant work experience.

Apart from the advertisment I have heard of your company trough your educational programmers, which I have been a part of severel times, and most of the times taking one of the first places in your competitions. Furthermore I was a part of the team that created the application "One for all" in the competition for young software engeneers that was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in which you were the golden sponsor. That is why I think I will fit in the position perfectly.

## 3. Essay
You have watched a documentary about what causes young people to start committing crimes. You have made the notes below.
Reasons why young people commit crimes
-   lack of control by parents
-   absence of opportunities in life
-   influence of friends
Some opinions expressed in the documentary:
'Without firm discipline from parents, some children are likely to get into trouble.'
‘It’s not surprising that young people who feel they have no chance of a good life turn to crime.'
‘The bad influence of people they mix with can cause some young people to take up crime.’



Weather we like it or not crimes are commited on daily basis. And statistics show that most of them are commited by people under the age of 30. Weather they hadn't had a parent figure to discepline them or they were under a bad influence, most of the times this have something to do with their childhood years.

Young teenages are very hard to deal with. And that is particular reason why some of the parents just give up and allow their teenagers to do as they please. This aproach in a matter of fact is not the best one yet there are sill parents that do not set limits for their childs. Terefore the parents give the impression to their teenager that if they do something bad it will not be punished

Another influencing figure in your life are your friends. And as we all know the only purpose in a life of a teenager is to look cool and not lame. And as a result of that they are trying dangeous and sometimes illeagal thing. But what they do not realise is that in one way or another they are influencing their friends to do the same bad mistakes.

To sum up, both parents and friends can be the cause of a future criminalist. However friend's bad influence can be stopped by none other but the parents of the teenager. Because they have the last word in the family.
