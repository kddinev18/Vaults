# ClassNote - Azure

Cloud Computing and Vocabulary
# Notes
## Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to
- **compute power** - meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
- **storage** - like files and/or databases
- **networking** - in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
- **analytics** - services for visualization and telemetry data

## Key concepts
- **scalability** - is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
- **elasticity** - is the ability to scale dynamically
- **agility** - is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
- **fault tolerance** - is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
- **disaster recovery** - is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
- **high availability** - is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system. availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
