# ClassNote - Linux

Talk is cheap, show me the code - **Linus Torvalds**
# Notes
## 1. Destribitions
There are distributions suited to every imaginable purpose. The major players in the market can be traced back to either Red Hat, Debian or Slackware.

## 2. Interfaces
There are two basic types of interfaces available that allow you to interact with the operating system.
- CLI
- GUI
#### **1. GUI**
In a GUI, applications present themselves in windows that can be resized and moved around. There are menus and tools to help users navigate. Graphical applications include web browsers, graphics editing tools and email, to name a few.
#### **2. CLI**
The second type of interface is theÂ command line interface (CLI), a text-based interface to the computer. The CLI relies primarily on keyboard input. Everything the user wants the computer to do is relayed by typing commands rather than clicking on icons.
